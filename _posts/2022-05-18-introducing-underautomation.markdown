I have always been passionate about industrial robotics. In 2021, I started to write a library able to make a software communicate with a Universal Robots robot. I challenged myself to implement all the protocols supported by this manufacturer in the following languages: .NET, LabVIEW, MATLAB and Python. This resulted in the UnderAutomation library.
